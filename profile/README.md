# Code of a Struggling Student :)

> [!NOTE] 
> This organization contains all my personal projects and assignments that i am currently working on or have worked on in the past that are related to my Computer Science degree at La Sapienza University of Rome. 

Some repositories may be currently private due to the fact that i am still working on them and i don't want to make them public yet. Also note that pinned repositories are not necessarily the ones that i am currently working on, but they are the ones that i want to highlight. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Some projects have been developed in collaboration with other students, so the code may not be entirely mine.
